## Why Vim

For now, opinons for the benefits of vim come form [CSDIY.wiki](https://csdiy.wiki/)

-   It keeps your finger on the keyboard throughout the development and moving the cursor without the arrow keys keeps your fingers in the best position for typing.
-   Convenient file switching and panel controls allow you to edit multiple files simultaneously or even different locations of the same file.
-   Vim's macros can batch repeat operations (e.g. add tabs to multi-lines, etc.)
-   Vim is well-suited for Linux servers without GUI. When you connect to a remote server through `ssh`, you can only develop from the command line because there is no GUI (of course, many IDEs such as VS Code now provide `ssh` plugins to solve this problem).
-   A rich ecology of plugins gives you the world's most fancy command-line editor.
