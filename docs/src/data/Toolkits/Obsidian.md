## Overview

Look back on the past, My notes about what I have learn often be threw away after the exam. It seems everything I have learned is in order to past the examination instead of what I really want or likes. But in the time of college study, I think I was found the aim and interested for my future life, which is the work of research.
Creative thing and contribute on the knowlagement of human are such a funning things for me to do.  

Actually, Obsidian is not the first tool I ever used to write on computer. 
The reason to use obsidian might comes from the recommend of Professor Liu, and the first purpose is used to write the paper of my research as well as the report for my literature reading. 
However, after the real attempts to  write any research paper on it, I found it's not as simple as Latex to print the equations and the citation of other's work. 
Therefore, the left use is to writing literature report.

Obsidian is an useful tool to use the [Markdown](Markdown.md) for writing and help me to gat a better schedule and diary.
An documentary and useful skill comes from the [obsidian文档咖啡豆](https://coffeetea.top/zh/)

Actually, we always want to collect something and this might make us feels good. 
However, to be honest, excepting we can truly understander the things we collected and use it to product, the collection is nothing itself.
